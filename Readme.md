#  Pothole Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains a **trained YOLOv8 object detection model** along with a **simple inference script** to detect potholes in road images.

The project is designed to demonstrate **end-to-end pothole detection**, from a trained deep learning model to practical image-based inference. It serves as a strong foundation for future extensions such as **mobile camera detection, web deployment, GPS-based mapping, and smart road monitoring systems**.

##  Model Performance

The model was evaluated on a validation dataset with the following results:

| Metric        | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| Precision     | **0.91** |
| Recall        | **0.775** |
| mAP@50        | **0.859** |
| mAP@50–95     | **0.505** |

### Performance Interpretation
- **High Precision:** Very few false positives
- **Good Recall:** Most potholes are detected
- **Strong mAP@50:** Accurate bounding box localization
- **Reliable generalization** on real-world road images

##  Inference Script

The repository includes a **simple Python inference script** that:
- Loads the trained YOLOv8 model
- Accepts an input image
- Runs pothole detection
- Draws bounding boxes with confidence scores
- Saves the output image

This script is intended for **testing and evaluating the trained model**.
